# Ivaldi

A working prototype of an evolved but simplified alternative to the Brokkr client in the Mjolnir system, designed for modularity, flexibility and simplicity. Contains basic monitoring, logging, and wireless data transmission, and designed for lightweight use cases where Brokkr's more specialized features are not needed.


## Installation and Setup

Built and tested under Python 3.7 (but should be compatible with Python >=3.6; lack thereof should be considered a bug) and recent (>= 2019) versions of the packages listed in the `requirements.txt` file and the ``setup.py``.
Works best on Linux, but should be fully functional on Windows (and _should_ work equally macOS) under the Anaconda distribution.
